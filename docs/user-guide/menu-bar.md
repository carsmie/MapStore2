#Menu Bar
*********

In this section you will learn how to use the *Menu Bar*. As mentioned before, it includes connections to the *Home Page* and the *Account*, and:  

Search Bar
----------
The *Search Bar* of the portal allows you to find point of interests (POIs), streets or locations by name or by coordinates.  

* From the *Home Page*, **Search** for *Map Sample* and **Open** it. 

* In the *Search Bar*, for example, **Type** the text "rome" then **Select** the first record. The map will automatically re-center on that area delimiting it by a polygon in the case of an area, by a line in the case of a linear shape (e.g. streets, streams) and by a marker in the case of a point.    

  <img src="img/rome.png" style="max-width:700px;" />

Option Menu
-----------
The *Option Menu* is the core of the *Menu Bar* and will be treated in details. It contains several options to add data from different sources to the map, perform measurments, and to save, print and share the created map.
